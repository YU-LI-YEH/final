(1) follow the line to an object
      Use OpenMV to detect a straight line.
      Send the parameters of the detected line (end points of lines as x1, y1, x2, y2) to mbed through UART connections.
      Steer BB car to go forward and follow the line.
(2) circle around the object
(3) use a AprilTag and PING to calibrate the location
      Use OpenMV to scan the above AprilTag codes. We can use the scanned AprilTag to determine the viewing angle from OpenMV to the AprilTag surface.
      Steer BB Car such that the car is facing directly and perpendicular to the AprilTag surface.
      Use PING to measure the distance between BB Car and AprilTag surface.
(4) follow another line to a destination
      Use OpenMV to detect a straight line.
      Send the parameters of the detected line (end points of lines as x1, y1, x2, y2) to mbed through UART connections.
      Steer BB car to go forward and follow the line.
